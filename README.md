This Project is created for a case study.
I have created a rest api calling an open source api and used spring resilience to handle failures and enable caching, i ran out of time so was unable to create test cases for unit testing.The url's used can be in properties file so that modification can be done without impacting or changing and building the code.
This a springboot rest api project that runs on embedded tomcat port 8080.
